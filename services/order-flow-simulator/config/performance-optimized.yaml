# Performance-Optimized Order Flow Simulator Configuration
# High Activity Mode - Designed for realistic trading simulation

simulator:
  # Rate limiting - Conservative activity to prevent database overload
  base_order_rate: 5.0            # 5 orders/second = 300 orders/minute
  max_orders_per_minute: 600      # Hard limit: 600 orders per minute maximum

  # Batch processing for efficiency
  batch_size: 10                  # Send 10 orders at a time
  batch_interval: "1s"            # Wait 1 second between batches

  # Volatility settings
  volatility_boost: 1.2           # Only 20% increase during volatility
  volatility_cooldown: "5m"       # 5 minute cooldown between volatility events

  # User behavior simulation
  user_types:
    retail: 0.8                   # 80% retail (slower, smaller orders)
    algorithmic: 0.15             # 15% algorithmic
    institutional: 0.05           # 5% institutional (large but infrequent)

  # Order characteristics for performance
  order_size_limits:
    min_quantity: 0.001           # Smaller minimum orders
    max_quantity: 10.0            # Reasonable maximum
    retail_max: 1.0               # Retail traders: max 1.0 units
    algo_max: 5.0                 # Algo traders: max 5.0 units
    institutional_max: 10.0       # Institutions: max 10.0 units

  # Market behavior
  symbols:
    - "BTC"
    - "ETH"
    - "SOL"                       # Reduced from 6 to 3 symbols

  price_variation: 0.01           # 1% price variation (less chaos)
  market_hours_boost: 1.1         # Only 10% more activity during "market hours"

  # Performance monitoring
  health_check_interval: "60s"    # Check health every minute
  auto_throttle: true             # Automatically reduce rate if errors occur
  error_threshold: 0.1            # Stop if 10% of orders fail

# Database connection optimization for simulator
database:
  max_retries: 3
  retry_delay: "2s"
  connection_timeout: "10s"
  query_timeout: "5s"

# Logging for performance monitoring
logging:
  level: "info"
  log_successful_orders: false    # Don't log every successful order
  log_rate_limits: true          # Log when rate limited
  log_batch_operations: true     # Log batch sends
